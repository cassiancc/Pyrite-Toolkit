# Pyrite Toolkit
The Pyrite Toolkit is a selection of Node.JS scripts that are used to datagen code for Pyrite.

## stategenerate
The main `stategenerate.js` script is the primary script used for Pyrite. It generates blockstates, models, language entries, and loot tables for all blocks and items in Pyrite. It is designed to output these files in a format compatible with 1.20.1-1.21.4. Future refinements will focus on adding functionality for tag generation.

## publish

The publish.py script is used to start the build tasks of multiple Pyrite projects, and copy them to a single folder for ease of upload to Modrinth and Curseforge. This may be retired in the future.
